6. üîß Integration Tips
Login first using /api/auth/login to receive a JWT Token.

Store the JWT in frontend state (e.g., localStorage or secure cookie).

Send the token in all API calls needing auth using the Authorization header.

Devices and reminders are role-specific, ensure user roles are respected in your frontend logic.

Use GET /api/reminders/ and display upcoming alerts to the patient on the main screen.

Handle server errors gracefully using the standardized message field.

The server uses rate limiting, avoid repeated rapid requests.

üñß Real-time Integration Notes
This backend supports WebSocket-based updates (websocket.service.js) and MQTT via mqtt.service.js.

Use WebSockets for real-time updates to device states and reminders.

MQTT is internally used for communication between backend and ESP32 devices.
